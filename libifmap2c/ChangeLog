0.3.0 - 10.07.2010

  The "Lets break things" release ;)

 Changes:

  * Switch the arguments of SSRC::purge(), The publisher-id goes first,
    then the session-id. This makes it consistent with the other SSRC
    methods.

  * Rename ErrorResultError into ErrorResult.

  * Add a _name attribute to ErrorResult, to be set if the ErrorResult is
    contained in a PollResult (name of subscription).

  * Create IfmapError as superclass for all errors except
    ErrorResult. A user therefore only needs to catch IfmapError and
    ErrorResult.

  * IfmapError and ErrorResult now support output to a stream. No need
    for the getMessage() calls anymore, e.g:
    
    try {
       ssrc.newSession();
       ssrc.publish(something);
       ssrc.endSession();
    } catch (IfmapError ifmapError) {
       cerr << ifmapError << endl;
    } catch (ErrorResult errorResult) {
       cerr << errorResult << endl;
    }

  * Rename SubPublish and SubSubscribe to PublishElement and
    SubscribeElement, respectively. The old names were just horrible.

  * SearchResult::getResultItem(Identifier i1, Identifier i2), to query
    a single ResultItem element changed to return a list of ResultItem
    objects, as there might be multiple ResultItems with the same
    Identifiers (depending on the MAPS used).

  * Disable "pretty printing" to generate the resulting XML document.

  * Rename SearchResult::getSearchResultName() into ::getName().

  * SSRC::newSession() max-poll-result-size parameter changed to int.

  * Add two more cratePublishUpdate() methods which make creation of
    updates containing a link "look better".

  * Introduce a UserMetadata class, which can be used to generate own
    metadata types.

  * Rename ResultItem::getMetadataList() to ::getMetadata()

 Bugfixes:

  * Rename InvalidSessionId back to InvalidSessionID...

  * PollResult objects now correctly may contain ErrorResult objects.
  
  * Revisited parsing of PollResults. It was "pretty broken" before.

  * Uninitialized iterator dereferencing in PollResult fixed.

  * Don't expect an ErrorString to be set in all ErrorResults,


0.2.0
  CHANGES:
	* add terminal-identifier-types to SearchRequest and
	  SubscribeUpdate parameters

  BUGS:
	* max-depth was set to max-size (SearchRequest + SubscribeUpdate)

	  inheritance

	* Accessing iterators in for-loops when it == end
	  fixed
