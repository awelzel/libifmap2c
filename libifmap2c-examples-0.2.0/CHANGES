0.2.0
	* Only some examples which were used to test the MAPS irond
	  - test-notify-event-twice (shows some subscribe/poll usage)
	  - test-update-twice (really simple, only for debug purposes)
	
	* single-multi-test renamed to singe-multi-test

0.1.1
	* test-close-conn:
	  - new example to demonstrate how the underlying TCP connection
	    of a SSRC is closed and how to keep the session alive using
	    renewSession calls on a new SSRC.
	
	* single-multi-test:
	  - Added Namespaces to the used metadata types
	    (Infoblox IBOS wants them, thanks to Akmal Khan)
	  - Don't do searches anymore, just check whether publishReceived
	    or InvalidMetadata is received.
