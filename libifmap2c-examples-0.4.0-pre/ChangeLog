0.4.0
        * Adapt code to compile with 0.4.0

	* Add some random testing files and move them into tests.

0.3.0
	* Adapted code to compile with 0.3.0, simplify exception handling,
	  split things a bit.

	* Include a folder called utils which besides ip-mac, also
	  provides other utilities to publish some standard metadata.
	  Nice for testing and scripting.
	
	  These tools optionally use environment variables for url. user,
	  password and capath. Those are called IFMAP_URL, IFMAP_USER,
	  IFMAP_PASSWORD and IFMAP_CAPATH, makes life easier.

	* Add a folder tests, with some code to mainly test the library,
	  but some MAPS functionality at the same point. Note, I mainly
	  checked against irond (0.2.3). omapd or IBOS might lead to
	  different results. If you think the expected behavior is wrong,
	  let me know.

	  As a note: The tests use identifier values which are based on
	  the basic-authentication username. This is done in order to
	  allow concurrent executions with different users without
	  interfering each other.
	

0.2.0
	* Only some examples which were used to test the MAPS irond
	  - test-notify-event-twice (shows some subscribe/poll usage)
	  - test-update-twice (really simple, only for debug purposes)
	
	* single-multi-test renamed to singe-multi-test

0.1.1
	* test-close-conn:
	  - new example to demonstrate how the underlying TCP connection
	    of a SSRC is closed and how to keep the session alive using
	    renewSession calls on a new SSRC.
	
	* single-multi-test:
	  - Added Namespaces to the used metadata types
	    (Infoblox IBOS wants them, thanks to Akmal Khan)
	  - Don't do searches anymore, just check whether publishReceived
	    or InvalidMetadata is received.

0.1.0
	* First release.
