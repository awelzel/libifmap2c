= Testing =

== Executable files contained with libifmap2c ==
In the {{{build}}} directory you will find, besides other, the follwing executable files:
  * {{{ip-mac}}} utility originally written by Roger Chickering, to publish and delete {{{ip-mac}}} metadata. It was adapted to use libifmap2c
  * {{{test-purge-publisher}}} simply runs the purgePublisher operation
  * {{{test-identifiers}}} does searches with depth=0 to test the Identifier parsing of the library

All examples use basic authentication, i.e. a username password combination, to authenticate with the MAPS. While libifmap2c provides support for certificate based
authentication, basic authentication is easier to set up.

== Open source IF-MAP 2.0 Server ==
To do testing one of the currently available open source IF-MAP 2.0 servers can be used.
  * [http://trust.inform.fh-hannover.de/joomla/index.php/downloads/54-iron irond]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/omapd/ omapd]

Till now, testing was done using irond. But omapd should work equally good.

== The {{{capath}}} parameter ==
All test programs listed above require as a last parameter a directory, which contains
the servers certificate in PEM format. This directory needs to be prepared using
OpenSSL's {{{c_rehash}}} command.

For example, in the build directory execute the following commands:
 * {{{mkdir capath}}}
 * {{{cp /path/to/servercert.pem capath}}}
 * {{{c_rehash capath}}}

== Running the {{{ip-mac}}} executable ==
The following command will publish {{{ip-mac}}} metadata to the link between
the IP 192.168.0.1 and the MAC 11:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff

{{{./ip-mac update 192.168.0.1 11:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff https://localhost:8443 test test capath/}}}

To delete the metadata again, use {{{delete}}} instead of {{{update}}} as the first
parameter. Or, to delete all metadata of the publisher associated with the username
test:

{{{./test-purge-publisher https://127.0.0.1:8443 test test capath/}}}

This assumes that you run an IF-MAP server on you local machine with port 8443
to be used for basic authentication, and the {{{capath}}} directory was created as described before. Further, test:test can be used as basic autentication credentials.
