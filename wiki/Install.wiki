= Building and Installing libifmap2c =
Building the library was tested on Slackware Linux 13.1. It was also
successfully compiled using Mac OS X. If you have problems building the
library using Linux, please let me know. At the moment I'm not doing
development using Windows.

==Prerequisites==
You need the following software to be able to successful compile libifmap2c.
Make sure you have the development packages for libxml2 and libcurl.

  * cmake (tested 2.8)
  * libxml2 (tested 2.7.7)
  * libcurl (min 7.19.1)

== Check-out source ==
 * Switch to a directory where you want to check out the source
 * {{{svn checkout http://libifmap2c.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ libifmap2c}}}

== Build ==
 * {{{cd libifmap2c/build}}}
 * {{{cmake ../}}}
 * {{{make}}}

== Install ==
If you want to install the library and header files into system directories, e.g.
{{{/usr/local/[lib/include]}}},
run {{{make install}}} as root. Don't forget to run {{{ldconfig}}} afterwards in
order to make use of the newly installed library.
